# Gesture_FruitNinja
This project is a Fruit Ninja style game that can be controlled using hand gestures. Using OpenCV and MediaPipe, the game detects your hand movements in real time via webcam, and allows you to "slice" fruits as they fall from the top of the screen. The faster and more accurate the swipe, the more fruits you can slice!
